        ("Member" or "Licensee"), hereby agree that TinkerMill will provide to the Member a license to the shared TinkerMill facilities located in

        <p>Notwithstanding the foregoing paragraph and notice period, TinkerMill reserves the right to terminate access to and use of TinkerMill's 
        facilities at any time, immediately and without notice, if the Member fails to comply with any provision of this Agreement and TinkerMill's 
        Policies and Procedures.</p>

        <p>TinkerMill reserves the right to amend the Policies and Procedures and Services Addendum from time-to-time and at its sole discretion.
        TinkerMill will notify Member of any changes to said rules and regulations in writing and prior to such rule changes taking effect.</p>

        <p>Upon termination of this Agreement, Member shall thereafter have no further right to use TinkerMill facilities in any manner and Member

        to Member, along with deposits, within 30 days of the termination of this agreement. Personal items must be removed from TinkerMill within 
        15 days of the termination of this agreement, after which period they become property of TinkerMill.</p>

        <h3>2. Description of Services.</h3>
        
        <p>TinkerMill agrees to provide Member with secured entry access to non-exclusive, clean, well-maintained equipment and workshop facilities,

        <h3>3. Member Obligations.</h3>
        
        <p>Member shall only use the facilities in accordance with TinkerMill Policies and Procedures. The shared facilities shall be kept in a neat,
        clean and attractive condition at all times.  Member will not cause any damage to any part of TinkerMill, including unreasonable or

        use and enjoyment of the Services by any other Member of TinkerMill or the use and enjoyment of the Building by any occupant of the Building.
        Member shall not use TinkerMill facilities for any inappropriate or unlawful activity including obscenity and use of material protected by 
        intellectual property laws.  Members shall not "live" at the TinkerMill facilities at any time (sleep/eat/shower beyond one 24 hour day - 
        exceptions may be made during multi-day hackathon events only).</p>

        <h3>4. Fees.</h3>
        
        <p>Member agrees to make payments on a timely basis. Failure to make monthly payments will result in termination of this Agreement and
        revocation of Member's license to use the facilities. In addition, Member shall pay all reasonable third party fees (attorney's fees and
        debt collection fees specifically included) and other costs incurred by TinkerMill in connection with any late payments or past due amounts.</p>

        <h3>5. Risk of Use.</h3>
        
        <p>Member acknowledges that he/she is using the facilities at his/her own free will and decision. Member acknowledges that TinkerMill does not 
        have any liability with respect to Member's access, participation in, use of the facilities, or any loss resulting from such participation or use.</p>

        <p>TinkerMill and its respective board members, employees, volunteers, instructors, agents, contractors and officers shall not, to the extent 
        permitted by law, be liable for, and the Member waives all right of recovery against TinkerMill and such individuals for any damage or claim 
        with respect to any injury to person or damage to, or loss or destruction of, any property of Member, its contractors, employees and invitees
        due to any act, omission or occurrence in or about TinkerMill or the Building. Except for gross or willful misconduct by TinkerMill, Member 
        agrees to indemnify, defend, protect and hold TinkerMill and its respective board members, employees, volunteers, instructors, agents, 
        contractors and officers harmless from and against all claims of whatever nature arising out of Member's use of the facilities and occupancy 
        of TinkerMill. Members are strongly encouraged to carry insurance that covers their personal equipment while using the workspace at TinkerMill.</p>

        <h3>6. Interruption of Service.</h3>
        
        <p>Member acknowledges that due to the imperfect nature of electronic communications, electronics and utilities, TinkerMill shall not be 
        responsible for damages, direct or consequential, which may result from the failure of TinkerMill to furnish any of the Services. TinkerMill 
        will, however, act in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner in working to remedy any flaws in the facilities or equipment, 
        or delays in providing access to the facilities or equipment to the Member.</p>

        <h3>7. Relationship of the Parties.</h3>
        
        <p>Member is not an employee or contractor of TinkerMill. TinkerMill has no right to work produced by Members or guests working at TinkerMill. 
        Members shall maintain all copyrights, patents and any other proprietary rights related to the Member's works that are created using the 
        facilities.</p>

        <h3>8. Partial Invalidity.</h3>
        
        <p>If any one or more of the provisions of this Agreement shall be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement shall not be 
        affected, and each remaining provision shall be valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law.</p>

        <h3>9. Waiver.</h3>
        
        <p>No delay or omission on the part of TinkerMill in exercising any right under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver of such right or of 
        any other right of TinkerMill, nor shall any waiver of such right or rights on any one occasion be deemed a bar to, or waiver of, the same 
        right or rights on any future occasion. The acceptance by TinkerMill of any payment, or of a sum less than is due, shall not be construed 
        as a waiver of any of TinkerMill's rights unless such waiver is in writing.</p>

        <h3>10. THIS AGREEMENT IS NOT A LEASE AND DOES NOT CREATE OR REFLECT ANY FORM OF TENANCY OR INTEREST IN REAL PROPERTY IN FAVOR OF MEMBER.</h3>
        
        <p>This agreement is subject and subordinate to a leave by and between TinkerMill and the owner of the Building. This agreement shall 
        terminate simultaneously with the termination of said lease. This agreement shall be governed by, interpreted and enforced in accordance 
        with the laws of the State of Colorado.</p>
        
        <h3>Services Addendum</h3>

        <h4>Policies and Procedures</h4>

        <p>TinkerMill strives to provide a safe, productive and fun work environment for its members. In light of this mission, we ask you to obey 
        the following policies and procedures for working in our facility. Failure to obey these policies and procedures can make our facilities 
        dangerous or unwelcoming to others, and such actions on your part may result in your license being terminated without notice. Please 
        take them seriously.  We reserve the right to change these policies and procedures as needed with sufficient notice to members.</p>

        <p><em>Individual Safety:</em> Obey all posted signs and literature pertaining to safe use of our facilities. These include but are not limited 
        to signs regarding appropriate shop clothing and protective gear, techniques for safe equipment use, material-specific precautions for 
        equipment, and machine tool lockouts. Do not use equipment you are not comfortable with or trained to use. Our strong preference is that 
        you not operate heavy machinery after normal hours without a partner in the facility; operate it individually at your own risk. Default 
        to asking for help if uncertain.</p>

        <p><em>Shared Safety:</em> In a shared and open facility like ours, it is possible for less experienced members to operate equipment 
        dangerously without knowing it. Please stay on the lookout for unsafe behavior, and approach and offer feedback to fellow members if you 
        believe they are working unsafely. Please notify a board member, the Sergeant at Arms or the toolmaster immediately if you believe any 
        piece of equipment or infrastructure to be unsafe.</p>

        <p><em>Respectful Behavior:</em> In both in-person and electronic interactions, behave respectfully, courteously, and professionally to 
        your fellow members. No discrimination, harassment, or hate speech shall be tolerated.</p>

        <p><em>Courtesy of Individual Spaces:</em> If you are licensing space from TinkerMill, please keep the space relatively orderly. Do not 
        enter any individual work spaces that are not yours without explicit permission.</p>

        <p><em>Courtesy of Shared Spaces:</em> Keep noise levels to a respectful minimum for the comfort and enjoyment of those in the immediate area.
        No loud music, tool use or other noise will be permitted in the open areas without the explicit permission of the members around you. No fumes 
        or flames are permitted in unventilated areas. Restore the shared spaces to be as clean or cleaner than when you found them. Please respect 
        and do not interrupt any official TinkerMill activities or classes in the shared spaces.</p>

        <p><em>Presence:</em> Inactivity and lack of physical presence at our community facility can be detrimental to our mission and prevent others 
        from using the space. Please inform us of any extended absences or extenuating circumstances that might prevent you from attending. Otherwise, 
        we expect members to make regular use of our facilities.</p>

        <p><em>Guests:</em> Non-member guests are permitted in TinkerMill so long as they do not use TinkerMill equipment or shared areas or interfere 
        with other members. Guests and their actions are the sole responsibility of the host member.</p>

        <p><em>Tolerance of Feedback:</em> Please be open to constructive feedback from fellow members, especially as it pertains to safe use of our 
        equipment and disrespectful communications or behavior.</p>
